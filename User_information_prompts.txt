Jun 2024 to Aug 2024 · 3 mos
Nanjing, Jiangsu, China · On-site
(Full version:
Built a production-grade RAG system that lets users ask natural-language questions over 500+ pages Chinese documents and get accurate, source-cited answers in seconds.
• Architected an end-to-end RAG pipeline for online QA platform covering over 500+ pages Chinese documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT), using LangChain LCEL with modular ingestion, retrieval, re-ranking, and generation layers with streaming support.
• Implemented hybrid retrieval combining BM25 (jieba segmentation) + BGE-M3 dense/sparse vectors in Milvus, fused via RRF — improving retrieval precision 35% over vector-only baseline. Integrated BGE-reranker-v2-m3 cross-encoder as a second pass (top-30 → top-5), improving NDCG@5 by 12 points at only ~50ms added latency.
• Designed a provider-agnostic LLM layer supporting ERNIE Bot, DeepSeek, and Qwen. Benchmarked both on Chinese QA across latency, cost, and accuracy
• Built an automated evaluation pipeline using RAGAS (Retrieval-Augmented Generation Assessment), tracking three core metrics: Context Recall (did we retrieve the right passages?), Faithfulness (is the answer grounded in retrieved context?), and Answer Relevancy (does the answer address the question?). Created a hand-annotated golden dataset of 100 question-answer pairs with source references spanning diverse query types (factual, comparative, temporal, multi-hop). Achieved 0.84 context recall and 0.82 faithfulness; reduced hallucination rate from 15% to 4%.
• Deployed via Docker Compose (one-command startup) with FastAPI + SSE streaming, Redis semantic caching (60% fewer API calls), and Langfuse tracing for per-step latency and cost monitoring. P95 latency <2s
• Build a backend server for AWS resource connection using javascript, REST API endpoints establishments, and LLM utilization

(Full version:
• Co-developed Dual Branches Video Modeling (DBVM), an end-to-end pipeline that splits video understanding into two branches: a Knowledge Graph branch for structural queries (entity recognition, relationship extraction, multi-modal feature fusion) and a Video-Language Model branch for non-structural queries (scene matching, sentiment retrieval, interaction prediction)

Developed a deep learning-based automated visual inspection system for quality control of electroplated PIM inductors and capacitors.
(Full version:
• Designed and trained 4 face-specific YOLOv8 object detection models for automated visual inspection of electroplated PIM inductors/capacitors. The system covers 20 distinct defect types (chipping, solder defects, rust, electrode exposure, plating peeling, dark cracks, etc.) across 4 inspection surfaces (A-face, B-face, C-short edge, C-long edge), achieving 91% mAP@50 — matching human inspector-level accuracy at 15ms per frame.
• Engineered a complete data pipeline handling 5,000+ images from a 7-camera inspection station. Built automated workflows for CLAHE contrast enhancement on reflective surfaces, camera-to-face routing, CVAT annotation in YOLO format, and stratified splitting (70/15/15). Designed a custom Albumentations augmentation strategy (Mosaic, Copy-Paste, HSV jitter) expanding effective training data 5× and improving rare-defect recall by 8%.
• Tackled severe class imbalance (some defects appeared <30 times) by combining Copy-Paste augmentation, Focal Loss, and class-weighted sampling. Ablation study confirmed the combined strategy improved mAP on rare categories (dark cracks, mixed materials) by 8% while maintaining common-defect performance.
• Conducted rigorous architecture comparison evaluating YOLOv5s, YOLOv7, YOLOv8s, and YOLOv8s+P2 (custom small-object detection head) on the hardest B-face dataset (10 classes). Controlled all variables: identical epochs, image size, augmentation, splits. Parallel augmentation ablation across 4 configurations. Documented in technical report with per-class AP and confusion matrices, directly informing production architecture decisions.

Projects

AI Agent-powered Resume & Cover Letter Generator
Oct 2025 - Feb 2026

(Full version:
An end-to-end AI system that generates tailored, ATS-optimized resumes and cover letters from job descriptions using a multi-agent orchestration pipeline — built to solve a real problem I experienced during my own job search.
• Architected a LangGraph StateGraph pipeline orchestrating 4 specialized agents (JD Analyzer → Relevance Matcher → Resume Generator → Cover Letter Agent) with Pydantic v2 structured outputs for schema-driven responses. Chose LangGraph over a simple LLM chain for its conditional edge routing: a quality-gate evaluates each generated resume and routes back to the generation agent with specific feedback if the score falls below threshold, up to 3 retries — ensuring consistent output quality across 50+ generations.
• Engineered a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using ChromaDB and BGE-M3 embeddings to ground generated content in real company context. Built automated web scraping with Firecrawl to index company career pages, about pages, and news articles, with metadata-tagged chunking (source type, content category, scrape date) for precise filtered retrieval. This reduced manual company research from ~2 hours to under 30 seconds per application.
• Built an automated dual-layer evaluation framework: a deterministic ATS scoring layer (spaCy NER + TF-IDF cosine similarity for keyword coverage, action verb density, and section completeness) combined with an LLM-as-a-judge self-critique loop using DeepEval's G-Eval rubrics. The self-critique feeds structured improvement feedback back into the LangGraph pipeline, creating a generate → evaluate → revise cycle that measurably improves output quality with each iteration.
• Developed the full-stack application with an async FastAPI backend (SQLAlchemy 2.0 + PostgreSQL for task persistence and resume version control), a React/TypeScript frontend featuring shadcn/ui components, Zustand + TanStack Query for state management, react-pdf for inline PDF preview, Recharts for skill-matching visualization, and react-diff-viewer for version comparison. Real-time multi-agent progress tracking via WebSocket with requestAnimationFrame batching prevents UI jank during streaming.
• Maintained production engineering standards: LaTeX compilation with smart retry logic (error feedback to LLM for auto-correction), Docker multi-stage builds, GitHub Actions CI/CD enforcing ruff linting + mypy strict type checking + pytest with 80%+ code coverage, and conventional commit history.
)
(Short Version:
• Architected a 4-agent LangGraph pipeline with quality-gated routing and retry loops to generate tailored resumes from job descriptions
• Engineered a RAG pipeline using ChromaDB and BGE-M3 embeddings over scraped company data, reducing manual research time by ~97%
• Built dual-layer evaluation with ATS keyword scoring (spaCy/TF-IDF) and LLM-as-a-judge self-critique, achieving 0.85+ quality correlation
• Deployed full-stack app with FastAPI, React/TypeScript, WebSocket streaming, PostgreSQL persistence, Docker, and 80%+ test coverage via CI/CD

Aerial Drone Footage – Lost Hiker Challenge
Sep 2023 - Apr 2024
• Developed a deep learning model using YOLOv8 to accurately detect lost hikers and survival items (e.g., backpacks, water bottles) in aerial drone footage, designed to accelerate search and rescue (SAR) operations.
• Managed the complete data lifecycle by sourcing and annotating a custom dataset of aerial images with Roboflow and applying extensive data augmentation (rotation, mosaic, brightness) to enhance model robustness.
• Implemented a Slicing-Aided Hyper Inference (SAHI) pipeline with OpenCV to process 4K video, significantly improving the model's ability to detect small, distant objects often missed by standard inference methods.
• Engineered a training pipeline utilizing transfer learning on a pre-trained YOLOv8 model, systematically monitoring and evaluating performance metrics like Mean Average Precision (mAP) on a hold-out test set.
• Built a practical inference script with OpenCV to process video feeds, draw bounding boxes on detected objects, and generate alerts by saving high-confidence frames for rapid operator review. Send timestamps and geographic coordinates of identified frames to the frontend.
• Created a frontend webpage using JavaScript that enables users to upload drone footage, view a preview of the processing, showcasing frames detected by the model with bounding boxes and geographic coordinates, and receive the processed footage from the server.
