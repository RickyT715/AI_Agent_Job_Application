Bridge enables faster, cheaper payments and borderless access to dollars via stablecoins. Through our APIs, businesses can send and receive funds across borders faster / cheaper vs. SWIFT and other fiat-only rails. Our virtual accounts enable international consumers and businesses to easily access, store and spend US dollars. Our payouts infrastructure enables platforms to disburse USD to anyone globally. We believe many trillions of dollars will move and settle through stablecoin payment rails. Bridge is pulling this future forward.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We have a small team of people who have previously built financial infrastructure at some of the world’s leading companies (Coinbase, Stripe, Square, Brex, Upstart, DoorDash, Airbnb) and each and every one of them chose Bridge because they fundamentally believe that stablecoins will be a critical piece of financial infrastructure that allows for the improvement of global money movement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As an early member of the Bridge engineering team, you will be given the autonomy to work on projects that are truly global in scale and aim to give customers access to products they&#39;ve never had access to. Many of the use cases that we work on today didn&#39;t exist several months ago and that&#39;s because our team is dedicated to constant improvement for our partners and end users. Our Engineers have outsized ownership over projects so if you are looking for increased autonomy working on a completely greenfield opportunity, Bridge is the place for you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ship software to build out our suite of API products. We’re an engineering and API-first company, and you will learn first-hand and contribute towards building highly reliable, performant, and mission critical infrastructure serving thousands of developers across the globe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Take sole ownership of projects, oftentimes without the support of Product Management, and liaise both internally with teams like Legal/Compliance and externally with our partners and developers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Look for constant improvements to our product offerings with the explicit goal of improving the experience for our partners and end users.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Make effective tradeoffs that consider business priorities, user experience, and a sustainable technical foundation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Improve engineering standards, tooling and processes for the team and our broader org.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualifications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;We are open to hiring engineers at various levels of seniority (SWE through Senior Staff) but at a minimum we are looking for somebody with 5+ years of experience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Experience building backend systems with SQL databases.

The Airbnb Senior SWE - Messaging Foundations position demands 5+ years of hands-on engineering experience, proven large-scale distributed systems architecture, and technical leadership — areas where Ruiqi, as a mid-level candidate still completing their Master's degree, falls considerably short. While their RAG/LLM and backend skills are genuinely relevant to the AI-powered messaging intelligence platform component, the core role centers on high-scale messaging infrastructure (think Kafka-level reliability, real-time systems at billions of events), cross-team technical leadership, and mentorship — none of which are evidenced in the resume.

As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazine’s Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the World’s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We realize people do not fit into neat boxes. We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that. We cannot complete our mission without building a diverse and inclusive team. We hire the best people based on an evaluation of their potential and support them throughout their time at Cloudflare.

We design and operate large-scale data systems, own the company’s data lake, ingestion infrastructure, and platform tooling, and develop end-to-end applications that transform complex datasets into fast, reliable, business-critical products used daily by go-to-market, product, and engineering teams. Our work sits at the intersection of data platforms, distributed systems, and product development, giving engineers the opportunity to own meaningful problems across the stack and build systems that truly run the business.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;rnc2Gd&quot; data-ast-node-id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;About the role&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;rnc2Gd&quot; data-ast-node-id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;We are looking for an experienced &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;rnc2Gd&quot; data-ast-node-id=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Full Stack Software Engineer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;rnc2Gd&quot; data-ast-node-id=&quot;5&quot;&gt; to join our Bengaluru team and help scale the next generation of our internal data products. In this role, you will build and operate the systems behind data-driven applications that power teams across the company, including go-to-market, engineering, and product.

You will focus on building scalable, reliable services and application backends, partnering closely with data and full-stack engineers to deliver new features and operate the pipelines and platforms behind our products. Our stack spans multiple languages and technologies, including Go, Scala, and ClickHouse, and continues to evolve. Many of our applications also incorporate strong AI components, giving you opportunities to work with modern AI infrastructure and tools such as vector databases, MCP-based services, and Workers AI.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Today the company runs one of the world’s largest networks that powers millions of websites and other Internet properties for customers ranging from individual bloggers to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare all have web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks.

Deployment Gates sit directly in customers’ CI/CD pipelines and use observability data to answer one of the hardest questions in software delivery:&lt;br&gt;Given everything we know right now, is this deployment safe to proceed?&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;In this role, you will:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Work on the evolution of Deployment Gates from static rules to AI-driven decisions, combining Datadog telemetry to detect and block faulty changes before they impact users&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Lead the design of progressive deployment automation, starting with zero-setup, conservative AI rules and evolving toward adaptive gates that learn from incidents and organizational patterns&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Design the foundation for autonomous remediation, connecting what changed in code to what broke in production, from blocking and rolling back unsafe deployments to proposing fixes and enforcing policies&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is a highly product‑minded engineering role: you’ll work from problem discovery and UX all the way to reliable, scalable production systems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At Datadog, we place value in our office culture - the relationships that it builds, the creativity it brings to the table, and the collaboration of being together.

However, this is a Staff Software Engineer role requiring deep distributed systems expertise, production-scale observability platform experience, and senior leadership/mentorship capabilities that a mid-level candidate still completing their Master's degree cannot credibly demonstrate. The location is also a significant mismatch, as the role is hybrid in Boston or New York, while the candidate prefers remote/Canada, and the salary range ($234K–$300K) far exceeds the candidate's stated expectation of $100K–$200K, suggesting a seniority gap as much as a compensation one.",

Today the company runs one of the world’s largest networks that powers millions of websites and other Internet properties for customers ranging from individual bloggers to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare all have web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazine’s Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the World’s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We realize people do not fit into neat boxes.

        "description": "&lt;p&gt;IDM is the team that works on Datadog APM integrations: the parts that connect Datadog to the tools and services customers use. The team’s job is to make it easier for engineers to build and maintain integrations over time, and to keep quality and reliability high.&amp;nbsp;You will build AI-assisted tools that help with day-to-day engineering work, like drafting code changes, suggesting fixes, and checking results with tests and other automated checks. The goal is building tools that engineers can trust in real production work. You’ll also work closely with other teams, understand how they work, and build solutions that fit their process.&amp;nbsp;You will define what “good” means for these tools, measure results, and improve them over time. You’ll set up evaluation and testing so the AI output stays correct and doesn’t silently get worse. This is a senior role with high ownership, from early prototypes to production and ongoing support.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At Datadog, we place value in our office culture - the relationships and collaboration it builds and the creativity it brings to the table.

Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the team&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Web Presence and Platform is organized into two pillars, each of which is grouped into pods that focus on the central tenets of Stripe&#39;s public mission. The Presence pillar creates industry-leading designs for Stripe’s front door surfaces, educating customers about the power of our platform, sharing Stripe’s ideas and expertise with the public, and driving adoption. The Platform pillar builds the internal machinery that powers these surfaces, and is responsible for making our websites fast, stable, and easy to update.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Together we design and build stripe.com and other sites that amount to what is, for many, their first impression of Stripe.

        "description": "Title: Staff Software Engineer - Fullstack\nCompany: Databricks\nLocation: Vancouver, Canada\nDescription: &lt;p&gt;Databricks is on a mission to simplify and democratize data and AI — from making the next mode of transportation a reality to accelerating the development of medical breakthroughs. We do this by building and running the world&#39;s best data and AI infrastructure platform so our customers can use deep data insights to improve their business. Founded by engineers — and customer obsessed — we leap at every opportunity to solve technical challenges, from designing next-gen UI/UX for interfacing with data to scaling our services and infrastructure across millions of virtual machines. And we&#39;re only getting started.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a Fullstack software engineer, you will work with your team and product management to make insights from data simple. We are looking for engineers that are customer obsessed, who can take on the full scope of the product and user experience beyond the technical implementation. You&#39;ll set the foundation for how we build robust, scalable and delightful products.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vancouver will be the newest R&amp;amp;D center for Databricks, expanding our presence in the Pacific Northwest. We are actively hiring world-class engineers to join us on our mission to democratize data + AI.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We envision the Vancouver site becoming a key driver of product innovation at Databricks. To start, we’re bringing a few strategic areas to the Vancouver site and we have several open roles across the teams below, including:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Log Analytics&lt;/strong&gt; - Our customers increasingly use Databricks to analyze petabyte-scale logs in real time. This creates new challenges across the entire data processing pipeline, including ingestion, indexing, processing, and the user experience itself.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI/BI &lt;/strong&gt;-&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.databricks.com/product/business-intelligence&quot;&gt; AI/BI&lt;/a&gt; is redefining Business Intelligence for the AI age. We launched this product last summer and have already seen tremendous adoption (98.7% of our data warehousing customers are already using AI/BI!). From rich dashboarding and advanced visualizations to powerful talk-to-your-data solutions, the products we are building involve exciting technical challenges across the entire stack.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unity Catalog Business Semantics &lt;/strong&gt;- Context is everything for AI. For enterprise data, that context needs to be governed and managed, which is what Unity Catalog Business Semantics offers. We recently launched our first Semantics modelling capability, Unity Catalog Metrics, this past Data + AI Summit but we have a lot more in store. Engineers on this team work at the intersection of large scale distributed systems, data modeling, governance, and AI enablement.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Databricks Apps - &lt;/strong&gt;Databricks Apps is one of the fastest growing products at Databricks, used by more than 2,500 customers who have created more than 20,000 apps — and it was only GA’ed this past June. The Apps team is one of the few teams that are exposed to low-level platform components (k8s, networking), owns fundamental tech (apps runtime and proxy), and is heavily investing in app builder AI agents.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we look for:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;10+ years of experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Passion for user experience and design and a deep understanding of front-end architecture.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Comfortable working towards a multi-year vision with incremental deliverables.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Motivated by delivering customer value.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Experience with modern JavaScript frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, or VueJs/Ember).&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;10+ years of experience with server-side web technologies (eg: Node.js, Java, Python, Scala, C#, C++,Go).&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Good knowledge of SQL.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Experience with cloud technologies, e.g. AWS, Azure, GCP, Docker, or Kubernetes.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Experience developing large-scale distributed systems.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pay Range Transparency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px;&quot;&gt;Databricks is committed to fair and equitable compensation practices.

Today the company runs one of the world’s largest networks that powers millions of websites and other Internet properties for customers ranging from individual bloggers to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare all have web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazine’s Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the World’s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We realize people do not fit into neat boxes. We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that.

We design and operate large-scale data systems, own the company’s data lake, ingestion infrastructure, and platform tooling, and develop end-to-end applications that transform complex datasets into fast, reliable, business-critical products used daily by go-to-market, product, and engineering teams. Our work sits at the intersection of data platforms, distributed systems, and product development, giving engineers the opportunity to own meaningful problems across the stack and build systems that truly run the business.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;rnc2Gd&quot; data-ast-node-id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;About the role&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;rnc2Gd&quot; data-ast-node-id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;We are looking for an experienced &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;rnc2Gd&quot; data-ast-node-id=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Full Stack Software Engineer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;rnc2Gd&quot; data-ast-node-id=&quot;5&quot;&gt; to join our Bengaluru team and help scale the next generation of our internal data products.

You will focus on building scalable, reliable services and application backends, partnering closely with data and full-stack engineers to deliver new features and operate the pipelines and platforms behind our products. Our stack spans multiple languages and technologies, including Go, Scala, and ClickHouse, and continues to evolve. Many of our applications also incorporate strong AI components, giving you opportunities to work with modern AI infrastructure and tools such as vector databases, MCP-based services, and Workers AI.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;About the team&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Payments Dashboard group is a newly formed organization focused on Stripe’s dashboard. This team serves as the platform, center of excellence, and owner of some of the highest visited pages on &lt;a href=&quot;http://stripe.com&quot;&gt;stripe.com&lt;/a&gt;’s merchant dashboard. These surfaces are used for core user flows with Stripe - including integration setup and settings, transactions list and data exports, receipts, and foundational operational pages. The forward-looking charter of this team is to establish new information architecture and a centralized place to configure, manage and optimize these user integrations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What you’ll do&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;We’re looking for a staff full-stack engineer to join this group. This engineer will be working alongside multiple engineering teams within the Payments Dashboard group, and with multiple organizations outside of it. They will work to enable the teams around them, focusing variously on core dashboard availability and latency, new information architecture and customer flows, and helping engineering teams work efficiently and optimize their operational load.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Design and reason about integration experiences with a strong focus on end-user simplicity and developer experience&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Build full-stack solutions across Stripe&#39;s ecosystem, including back-end services, dashboard interfaces, and integrations with other Stripe primitives&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Engage directly with users to understand their business needs and translate requirements into concrete solutions&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Collaborate with cross-functional teams including product, design, and other engineering teams to deliver these solutions&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Write code in your day-to-day job, in addition to helping make those around you better view code review and design feedback&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Help scale our systems to handle millions of transactions while maintaining high availability and performance&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who you are&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role.
